<h1 class="translated">VP Pence calls on Google to end work on a search engine for China • TechCrunch</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/mike-pence-google-dragonfly/">https://web.archive.org/web/https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/mike-pence-google-dragonfly/</a></blockquote><div><div class="article-content">
				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">On Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence called for Google to end its development of a search engine custom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207112449/https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/google-china-return-search/">built to accommodate</a> China’s disposition for censorship.</p>
<p class="translated">Pence gave the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207112449/https://www.hudson.org/events/1610-vice-president-mike-pence-s-remarks-on-the-administration-s-policy-towards-china102018">speech at a conservative think tank</a> in D.C., dipping into a range of anti-Beijing sentiments, from intellectual property concerns to tariffs and the trade war. Pence didn’t mince words, calling on Google to abandon its plans for a China-friendly mobile version of its otherwise ubiquitous search engine.</p>
<p class="translated">Pence accused any company with plans to work around Chinese internet restrictions of “abetting Beijing’s oppression” and didn’t hesitate to call the search giant out by name:</p>
<blockquote><p class="translated">More business leaders are thinking beyond the next quarter, and thinking twice before diving into the Chinese market if it means turning over their intellectual property or abetting Beijing’s oppression. But more must follow suit. For example, <strong>Google should immediately end development of the “Dragonfly” app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers…</strong></p>
<p class="translated">More journalists are reporting the truth without fear or favor, and digging deep to find where China is interfering in our society, and why – and we hope that more American, and global, news organizations will join in this effort.</p>
<p class="translated">More scholars are speaking out forcefully and defending academic freedom, and more universities and think tanks are mustering the courage to turn away Beijing’s easy money, recognizing that every dollar comes with a corresponding demand. We’re confident that more will join their ranks.</p>
<p class="translated">And across the nation, the American people are growing in vigilance, with a newfound appreciation for our administration’s actions to re-set America’s economic and strategic relationship with China, to finally put America First.</p></blockquote>
<p class="translated">Pence’s full remarks are available on the Hudson Institute’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207112449/https://www.hudson.org/events/1610-vice-president-mike-pence-s-remarks-on-the-administration-s-policy-towards-china102018">website</a>.</p>
<p class="translated">Google’s covert project, known as Dragonfly, is reportedly a version of the search engine that blocks forbidden sites like Facebook and Twitter, censors search terms like the Tiananmen Square massacre and cuts out prominent Western news sources like the BBC and The New York Times. The project, first reported by the Intercept, sparked internal turmoil at the company and a letter of protest from employees who felt too in the dark to make “ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment.”</p>
<p class="translated">抛开谷歌的戏剧不谈，彭斯对中国的强硬言论可能是政治上的权宜之计，但不无讽刺:特朗普政府一再表示对自由媒体的公然蔑视，这是中国等积极限制政府的标志。彭斯对中国“无与伦比的监控国家”的嘲笑也相当丰富，因为国内政策对未经授权的监控也是如此。</p>
<p class="translated">副总统还借此机会重申了中国“干预”美国中期选举的争议性说法，呼应了经常用来描述俄罗斯经证实的选举干预努力的措辞。特朗普总统上周<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207112449/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/without-evidence-trump-accuses-china-of-interfering-in-us-midterm-elections/2018/09/26/c0069910-c19d-11e8-b338-a3289f6cb742_story.html">也提出了同样的建议，声称中国“一直试图干涉我们即将于11月举行的2018年大选，反对我的政府。”昨天，国土安全部Kirstjen Nielsen </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207112449/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2018/10/03/the-cybersecurity-202-no-indication-china-intends-to-interfere-with-midterm-elections-homeland-security-secretary-nielsen-says/5bb384431b326b7c8a8d17c5">拒绝支持总统未经证实的说法，指出中国追求一种“整体方法”来培养在美国的正面形象</a></p>
