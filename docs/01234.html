class="translated">如果你梦想中的家需要在冰箱上安装一个大屏幕，那么 Family Hub 就适合你。三星一直在开发一些定制功能，将冰箱变成一个实用的家庭共享显示器。该公司在 CES 上宣布对 Family Hub 进行更新，增加新功能。</p>
<p class="translated">界面已经完全重新设计了。应用程序应该能够比以前更好地相互交流。而且不再局限于冰箱了。你可以从冰箱启动烤箱，控制家中所有连接的设备等等。</p>
<p class="translated">有了 family board，您可以为其他家庭成员留言、查看日历信息以及查看照片。即使你不在家，你也可以用你的三星手机给你的孩子写一张便条，以防你会晚一点回家。</p>
<p class="translated">当然，比克斯比也在这里。三星的语音助手可以让你提问，找到食谱，控制你的家。</p>
<p class="translated">Family Hub 听起来是一个不错的功能，但主要问题是，你需要升级所有的电器，以创建一个与三星生态系统完全兼容的家庭。此外，我们真的需要另一个屏幕吗？</p>
