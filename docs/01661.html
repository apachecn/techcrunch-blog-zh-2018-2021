				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">Besides binge-watching TikTok videos and battling enemies in the magical land of mobile games, many Chinese people may also pass time during the upcoming Lunar New Year on<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221209041434/https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E5%BC%BA%E5%9B%BD/id1426355645?mt=8"> Xuexi Qiangguo</a>, a news and chat app developed by the country’s top ideology officials.</p>
<p class="translated">The app managed to top the Chinese App Store between January 22 and 25 before two ByteDance apps pushed it down to the third place this week, download statistics from App Annie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221209041434/https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/e5ada6e4b9a0e5bcbae59bbd/rank-history/?vtype=day&amp;countries=CN&amp;device=iphone&amp;view=rank&amp;legends=22&amp;date=2019-01-03~2019-02-01">shows</a>.

<p class="translated">It doubles as an instant messenger, with development support provided by Alibaba’s Dingtalk enterprise communications tool. That means users can log in via their Dingtalk account and chat with their Dingtalk contacts directly over Xuexi Qiangguo.</p>

<p class="translated">Directly translated as “studying strengthens the nation,” Xuexi Qiangguo is the product of a research center under China’s Publicity Department, an important organ in charge of how information disseminates in the country. The digital weapon underscores the Communist Party’s growing efforts in recent years to appeal to phone-savvy generations, though the app seems to have peaked.</p>
<p class="translated">As of February 1, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221209041434/https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E5%BC%BA%E5%9B%BD/id1426355645?mt=8">iOS version</a> of Xuexi Qiangguo is rated 2.4 out of 5 from 6,810 reviews. Its impressive download number, as it turns out, is in part a result of a top-down order. Many early users are Party members or work in China’s giant state apparatus, who were told to install the app. Several users TechCrunch spoke to, including a public school principal, a director of a district party committee and a municipal government official, confirmed that everyone in their organizations must download the app and every now and then, users may get quizzed on relevant content.</p>
<p class="translated">Newspapers and social media posts also suggest local governments have mandated downloads among Party members and encouraged the general public to give it a try. Some take a step further to organize offline study sessions for the app. For some context, China had nearly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221209041434/http://en.people.cn/n3/2018/0702/c90000-9476726.html">90 million</a> Communist Party members by the end of 2017.</p>

<p class="translated">“我相信大部分的下载都是受到激励的，可能只有很少一部分是由真正的利益引发的，”克里斯汀·施-库普费尔说，他是德国一家专门研究中国的智库——MERICS [^ T1]公共政策和社会研究领域的主任。“这款应用可能很快就会退出任何应用商店的排名。”</p>
<p class="translated">为了吸引更年轻的人群，该应用程序从中国蓬勃发展的网络世界的新媒体形式中获得了启示。例如，新闻部分似乎是模仿字节跳动流行的新闻应用程序金日今日头条。今日头条使用算法来理解用户偏好，并从各种第三方出版物中提供内容，而习雪郭强则从18家国有媒体中策划内容。</p>
<p class="translated">该应用程序还有一个游戏化的忠诚度计划，当用户完成一项任务时，如每天登录，就会奖励用户虚拟积分。因为注册是以实名制为基础的，主管可以检查他们组织中谁没有安装该应用程序，这带来了一种新的数字监控。</p>
<p class="translated">“这款应用的发布时间可能与即将到来的中国春节有关，中国共产党认为这是一个传播其意识形态的机会和必要条件，”施-库普费尔指出。“(它)可能是希望人们会利用假期仔细看看，但可能也知道大多数人宁愿选择其他来源来放松、消费和旅行。”</p>
