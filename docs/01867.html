				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">Reddit has said the number of government requests for user data more than doubled in 2018 than on the previous year.</p>
<p class="translated">The news and content sharing site said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230317044647/https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018">in its latest transparency report</a>, posted Wednesday, it received 752 requests from governments during the year, up from 310 requests a year earlier.</p>
<p class="translated">Broken down, that’s 171 requests to preserve account data — up from 79 requests in 2017, and 581 requests to produce user data — up from 231 requests.</p>
<p class="translated">Reddit said it complied with 77 percent of requests to turn over user data, and <span>91 percent of preservation requests. However, the company </span>says it “only processes preservation requests” that originate in the U.S.</p>
<p class="translated">For the year, the company said it was asked by the U.S. government to remove “an image and a large volume of comments made underneath it for potential breach of a federal law,” without saying what the post was. But Reddit said it did not comply with the “overbroad” request as the government didn’t demonstrate illegality.</p>
<p class="translated">Noticeably absent from the transparency report are any figures relating to national security. There hasn’t been an update since 2016.</p>
<p class="translated">The company had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230317044647/https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014">posted a warrant canary in its debut 2014 report</a>, confirming that at the time it had “never received a National Security Letter, an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or any other classified request for user information.” In its transparency report a year later, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230317044647/https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015">notice was removed</a>, indicating that Reddit had received a national security request but was permitted from disclosing it.</p>
<p class="translated">We contacted Reddit for comment but didn’t hear back at the time of writing.</p>
<p class="translated">Reddit, a platform known for its freedom of speech (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230317044647/https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/when-your-ceo-is-a-troll-too/">sometimes infamously</a>) has come under increased scrutiny by its users in recent days following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230317044647/https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/reddit-300-million/">a $300 million Series D investment</a> from Chinese tech giant Tencent, prompting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230317044647/https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/tencent-reddit-nononono/">the mass posting of Winnie the Pooh</a>, a symbol said to represent Chinese president Xi Jinping, as a protest against Beijing’s vast internet censorship.</p>
