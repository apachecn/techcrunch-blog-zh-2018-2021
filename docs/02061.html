<p class="translated"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230226092400/https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"> App Store审查指南</a>是详细的规则，定义了你在App Store上能做什么和不能做什么。一旦你注册了开发者账户并向App Store审核团队提交了应用，你就同意遵守这些规则。这是一个很长的文档，但是标题为“垃圾邮件”的规则4.3很简单:</p>
<blockquote><p class="translated">不要创建同一个应用程序的多个捆绑包id。如果您的应用程序针对特定地点、运动队、大学等有不同的版本。，考虑提交单个应用程序，并使用应用内购买提供变化。也要避免堆积在一个已经饱和的类别上；App Store已经有足够多的屁、打嗝、手电筒和爱经应用了。向商店发送垃圾邮件可能会导致您从开发者计划中除名。</p></blockquote>
<p class="translated">一位知情人士在App Store中看到了一个特定的类别——VoIP应用程序，可以让你获得第二个电话号码，并从这个新号码收发电话和短信。我自己也看了那个类别，下面是我的调查结果。</p>
<p class="translated">公司甚至不会试图隐瞒这样一个事实，即提交了同一个应用程序的不同名称和图标的多个版本。但是核心特征保持不变。苹果没有很好地执行自己的指导方针，开发者利用了这个灰色地带。</p>
<h2 class="translated">例子1:短信</h2>
<p class="translated">正如你在<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230226092400/http://www.textmeinc.com/">公司网站</a>上看到的，TextMe目前运营着三个应用程序，并且是公开的——TextMe Up、text me和FreeTone。这三款应用在应用商店的平均评价都是4.7星，总共有几十万条评论。</p>
<p class="translated">每个应用程序的措辞略有不同。TextMe Up可以让你“通过手机、平板电脑和电脑给世界上的任何人打电话和发短信”，而TextMe可以让你“获得一个新的电话号码，开始免费发短信和打电话”，而FreeTone则完全是“[享受]给美国和加拿大的电话号码免费打电话和发短信。”</p>
<p class="translated">但如果你看看App Store的截图，该公司甚至不屑于更改截图或营销文案。</p>

<p class="translated">“我们的应用程序有不同的营销目标，”TextMe，Inc .的联合创始人兼联合首席执行官Patrice Giami在电话采访中告诉我。“它们共享相同的代码库，但我们可以激活或停用一些功能，以区分应用程序。我们根据竞争环境以及我们是否需要优化分销来管理这一点。”</p>
<p class="translated">Giami还认为他的公司遵守了App Store的指导方针。“苹果正在进行非常系统的审查——我们不断受到审查，因为我们发布了许多应用程序更新。我们从未被苹果标记或联系过——他们从未说过我们要发布同一个应用程序的完整克隆版本，”他说。</p>
<p class="translated">TextMe的三个应用程序使用同一个开发者账户，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230226092400/https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/textme-inc/id307996876"> Text Me，Inc </a>。如果苹果愿意，它可以很容易地比较这些应用程序。</p>
<h2 class="translated">示例2: BinaryPattern和灵活数字有限责任公司</h2>
<p class="translated">这个案子有点复杂。这些应用背后的公司有两个不同的开发者账户，并试图区分其应用商店列表。类似地，不同应用的按钮和颜色也略有不同，但都是相同的功能集。</p>

<p class="translated">我已经联系了BinaryPattern/Flexible Numbers，但没有收到回复。</p>
<h2 class="translated">例3: Appsverse公司。</h2>
<p class="translated">这次Phoner，二线，文字刻录机都共用<a title="Appsverse Inc." href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230226092400/https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/appsverse-inc/id430200227?mt=8">同一个开发者账号</a>。尽管这些应用程序可以让你做同样的事情，但Appsverse已经在三个不同的应用程序商店类别中发布了它的应用程序——实用程序、生产力和社交网络。</p>
<p class="translated">通过这样做，该公司的应用程序出现在多个类别中。文本燃烧器在社交网络中排名第88，第二行在生产力中排名第74，电话在公用事业中排名第106。</p>
<p class="translated">这似乎有点违反直觉，因为Appsverse在多个应用程序之间分割下载。但我认为该公司发布多个应用的主要原因是为了关键词优化和应用商店搜索结果。然后，它为每个应用程序选择不同的类别，但这是一个副作用。</p>
<p class="translated">Appsverse发给我以下声明:</p>
<blockquote><p class="translated">该指南促进了一个健康的应用商店生态系统，这对开发者和用户都有好处。它可以防止在商业模式、功能、使用案例和人口吸引力方面没有差异的类似应用的扩散。</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="translated">公平竞争机会</h2>
<p class="translated">这些公司没有做任何违法的事情。他们利用了苹果对App Store规则缺乏监管。发布同一个应用的多个版本是一个很好的应用商店优化策略。这样，您可以选择不同的名称、不同的关键字和不同的类别。潜在客户很可能会在他们的应用商店搜索结果中看到你的应用。</p>
<p class="translated">虽然苹果通常对应用商店的指导方针非常严格，但它并没有强制执行其中的一些。这对于遵守游戏规则的应用开发者来说是不公平的。他们无法有效地与那些知道他们可以忽略一些规则的公司竞争。</p>
