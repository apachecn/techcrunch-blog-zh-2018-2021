<p class="translated">这并不是说你不能通过其他方式获得图形——游戏玩家没有那么自虐。有各种大小和风格的“瓷砖包”，任何玩家都可以应用到游戏中，使其更容易遵循；事实上，两个流行磁贴的创作者，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230124073451/http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=161047.0"> Meph </a>和<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230124073451/http://goblinart.pl/vg-eng/df.php"> Mike Mayday </a>被请来帮助制作“官方”磁贴，顺便说一下，<em>看起来不错</em>。Kitfox Games (可爱的<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230124073451/http://www.kitfoxgames.com/shrouded-isle/">笼罩岛</a>的制造商)在艺术、音乐和其他一些事情上提供帮助。</p>
<p class="translated">还有很多其他的小修改和改进是由专注的玩家做的。其中许多可能会被移植到Steam Workshop上，安装起来也很容易——这是付费玩家的另一个收获。游戏出来的时候要20美元。</p>
<p class="translated">现在，我应该指出，我一点也不觉得这有什么麻烦。我支持Tarn和Zach无论他们选择做什么，无论如何原始的ASCII版本将永远是免费的。但是让我感到不安的是他们这样做的原因。<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230124073451/https://www.patreon.com/posts/25343688">正如Tarn在一次罕见的非游戏更新中在Patreon上写的那样</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p class="translated">我们很少谈论这个，但多年来，扎克一直在服用昂贵的药物，幸运的是，他的医疗保健涵盖了这些药物。这是一个持续关注的来源，因为该计划已经改变了几次，随着政治环境的变化。我们还有其他的家庭健康风险，随着年龄的增长，我们的处境越来越不稳定；在扎克最近的癌症恐慌后，我们决定用我的医疗保健计划的共付额等。如果我必须经历同样的程序，我会筋疲力尽的。也就是说，众筹是我们目前的主要收入来源，也是我们还在这里的原因。你的支持仍然是至关重要的，因为Steam的发布可能会也可能不会给我们带来我们现在所寻求的额外的稳定性，这需要几个月的时间。</p></blockquote>
<p class="translated">听说两个开发者的游戏如此受欢迎，并通过Patreon赚了一笔不多的钱，却仍然因为慢性疾病而害怕突然破产，这真是令人难过。</p>
<p class="translated">这不是政治辩论的地方，但人们会希望，像这样成功的小企业的创造者不必在世界上最富裕的国家担心这些事情。</p>
<p class="translated">也就是说，他们似乎对转移到真实的图形和增加更传统的收入流感到舒服，所以社区(包括我自己)无疑会看到这一点的光明面，并继续支持这种新形式的游戏。</p>
