<p class="translated">经过多年的挑逗和暗示，特斯拉首席执行官埃隆·马斯克终于推出了Model Y，这是一款中型全电动汽车，计划于2020年秋季上市。</p>

<p class="translated">Y型与3型有惊人的相似之处。这款车将采用标准的远程双电机全轮驱动和高性能车型，比Model 3稍大，可以容纳7人(对于选择支付3000美元充电费的人来说)。它的位置也比Model 3略高。最显著的区别之一是Y型车有一个全景车顶。</p>
<p class="translated">这就是差异开始消失的地方。</p>
<p class="translated">Model Y的内饰与Model 3相同，包括相同的15英寸触摸屏界面，以及门把手等其他功能。</p>

<h2 class="translated">其他重要规格</h2>
<p class="translated">标准射程版本起价为39，000美元，射程为230英里。然而，特斯拉将首先生产性能，双电机和远程版本。想要标准版Model Y的客户至少要等到2021年春季。性能和双电机版本将能够在一次充电后行驶280英里，而远程版本，正如它听起来的那样，将具有最长的里程，为300英里。</p>
<p class="translated">所有的变体都被设计成具有与其较小的兄弟同类相同的性能。Model Y的性能版本将能够在3.5秒内从0到60英里/小时，最高时速可达150英里/小时。</p>
<p class="translated">但是这种性能需要付出更高的代价。性能版起价6万美元。双电机版本的起价为51，000美元，远程版本的基础价格为47，000美元。</p>

<p class="translated">马斯克没有说Model Y将在哪里生产，也没有透露车辆规格和模糊时间表以外的其他细节。</p>
<p class="translated">他确实对Model Y做出了乐观的预测，在活动结束时表示，他预计Y的销量将超过Model S和Model X的总和。特斯拉迄今已售出超过50万辆汽车，包括Roadster、S、X和3。</p>
