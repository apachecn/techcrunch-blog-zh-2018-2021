<p class="p2 translated">据传闻，谷歌正在推出更实惠的Pixel 3手机版本。</p>
<p class="p2 translated">为了降低价格，他们稍微降低了处理器(从骁龙845到骁龙670)，将存储容量限制在64GB，并取消了无线充电功能。从好的方面来说，他们找到了3.5毫米耳机插孔的空间！</p>
<p class="translated">Pixel 3a的起价为399美元，配备5.6英寸显示屏、122万像素后置摄像头，开箱即可运行Android P。Pixel 3a XL的起价为479美元，并将屏幕提升至6.0英寸。</p>
<p class="translated">TechCrunch的Brian Heater在本周早些时候检查了这些设备。你可以在这里找到他的印象。</p>

<p class="p2 translated">与此同时，它有了一个更大的兄弟:以Nest Hub为例，将显示屏从7英寸提高到10英寸，并添加一个摄像头——这就是Nest Hub Max。Nest Hub Max将绑定到Nest应用程序中，允许它像任何其他Nest cam一样工作。谷歌表示，背面的硬件开关可以禁用摄像头/麦克风(唉，似乎你不能禁用其中一个而不禁用另一个)。售价229美元，今年夏天发货。</p>
<p class="translated">Nest Hub Max上的新“面部匹配”功能将识别您的面部，以定制其响应。在一篇关于该功能的博客文章中，谷歌表示，“面部匹配的面部识别是通过设备上的机器学习在本地处理的，所以摄像头数据永远不会离开设备。”</p>

<p class="p2 translated">在去年的I/O大会上，谷歌推出了人工智能客户服务工具Duplex，旨在帮助小企业(如餐馆和发廊)接听更多电话，回答常见问题，安排预订或约会。</p>
<p class="p2 translated">今年，它将在此基础上进一步扩展，向网络开放双工功能。以在线租车预订为例；你说“通过[租赁公司]帮我租一辆车”，它就会打开那家公司的网站，自动开始为你订车。它可以根据你在Gmail中找到的之前的租车确认，预先填写你日历中的旅行日期和汽车偏好。</p>
