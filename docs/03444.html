<p class="p1 translated">去年ZenBook Pros上的触摸板替代品似乎是一个新奇的东西，额外给了你一个小的额外屏幕，用于消息应用程序、视频和简单的实用应用程序，如计算器。然而，ZenBook Pro Duo上更大尺寸的第二块屏幕带来了许多新的可能性。它的两个屏幕都是触摸屏，用手指在窗口之间移动应用需要一点点习惯，但它很简单直观(常用的应用也可以被钉上)。</p>
<p class="p1 translated">在一次演示中，华硕的一名员工向我展示了它如何支持地图的双重显示:较大的屏幕可以让你鸟瞰地理，而第二个屏幕可以让你划分街道和位置。但ZenBook Pro Duo的主要吸引力在于多任务处理，让你在使用Office 365或视频会议等应用程序的主屏时，可以监控电子邮件、发送消息、观看视频、关注新闻标题和其他任务。</p>
<p class="p1 translated">基本上，华硕ZenBook Pro Duo 14是为喜欢使用第二显示器(或厌倦了将手机或平板电脑作为临时第二屏幕)的任何人设计的，但也希望PC具有更高的便携性。ZenBook Pro Duo的重量为2.5千克，并不是周围最轻的笔记本电脑，但考虑到其规格和两个屏幕，仍然是相当轻的。</p>

<p class="p1 translated">其英特尔酷睿i9 HK处理器和英伟达RTX 2060确保两个屏幕都能流畅运行，即使打开多个标签和应用程序。华硕还与哈曼/卡顿合作生产扬声器，这意味着音质应该优于平均水平。一个更小的版本ZenBook Duo也可以使用，它的两个显示器都采用了Core i7和GeForce MX 250和HD，而不是4K。</p>
<p class="p4 translated"><span class="s3">华硕尚未宣布定价和供货情况。</span></p>
