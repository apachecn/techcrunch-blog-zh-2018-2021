<h1 class="translated">Apple is now restricting Chinese language podcasts in China </h1>

				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">Just as podcasting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/why-spotify-is-betting-big-on-podcasting/">hits the mainstream in the west</a>, China, which is also experiencing an audio boom, is seeing restrictions tighten around shows as evidenced by new curbs from Apple.</p>
<p class="translated">This week, the U.S. tech giant has pulled a handful of Chinese-language podcasts from its Chinese Podcasts store, one of the few remaining channels for people in mainland China to find content immune from scrutiny by the country’s media regulators.</p>
<p>The crackdown seems to be taking an incremental pace so far. Three podcasters, including hosts of NickTalk and Two I.T. Uncles (两个 iT 大叔), confirmed with TechCrunch on Tuesday that their shows disappeared from Apple’s Chinese Podcasts app this week.</p>
<p>Several other noted shows, including Yitianshijie (一天世界), appear to remain unaffected, while others, such as <span>Suijiya (随机鸭), seem to have suffered from a partial blockade. That’s to say that individual episodes appear in search results, but the podcast homepages are inaccessible, which makes it impossible for new subscribers to sign up.</span></p>

<p class="translated">In an email reply to Two I.T. Uncles reviewed by TechCrunch, Apple confirmed that the podcast is currently available in “all territories except China,” adding that “only shows from select partners are available in the Chinese Apple Podcasts store.”</p>
<p class="translated">Apple did not provide further details as to what it means by “select partners.” TechCrunch has contacted the company for clarification, but we had not heard back at the time of writing.</p>
<p class="translated">The removals appear to be ill-timed, coinciding with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/a-look-at-the-many-ways-china-suppresses-online-discourse-about-the-tiananmen-square-protests/">thirtieth anniversary of China’s Tiananmen Square crackdown</a>, which falls on June 4th and has already led to tighter control on China’s online discourse.</p>

<p class="translated">That’s a big deal for Apple, as people have long celebrated its Podcasts app as unhampered by Beijing’s censorship. The IPN, a variety of popular Chinese talk shows on different topics, has repeatedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/https://blog.yitianshijie.net/2017/11/11/xuanmei-relaunches/">urged</a> listeners to choose international services like Apple Podcasts, Castro and Overcast over Himalaya FM, Lizhi FM and other local counterparts that are prone to Chinese reins.</p>
<p class="translated">Some have foretold the curbs, arguing that this marks Apple’s latest step to fill a regulatory loophole in its Chinese service. Word on the street has it that the American company’s “select partners” might include Himalaya and Lizhi, which not only deliver shows to listeners but also host the content.</p>
<p class="translated">Under Chinese laws, they must screen the podcasts before making them public. In other words, if Apple China starts requesting episodes to be kept on these platforms, the content will come under scrutiny by China’s often murky and vague media policies.</p>
<p class="translated">The tie-up, however, “could make Apple’s podcast operations more law-abiding in China,” suggested Wang Boyuan, editor at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/https://techcrunch.cn/">TechCrunch.cn,</a> TechCrunch’s content partner in China.</p>
<p class="translated">相比之下，苹果播客作为播客 RSS 源的目录，保存了节目存储在哪里以及新一集何时添加的信息，这意味着与托管服务相比，它通常更不受干扰。</p>
<p class="translated">“苹果播客商店就像一个聚合搜索引擎，”NickTalk 的主持人 Nick Zhang 说。“这就是为什么我关于六四事件的那集还能照常播放。”</p>
<p>A number of popular English-language podcasts from the west have long been unavailable in the Chinese store, but the latest crackdown seems to have extended the control to overseas Chinese content. Chinese podcasts uploaded from non-Chinese Apple accounts were also being restricted, according to a Telegram notice posted by the show Renjian Zhinan (人间指南), citing tests it had performed.</p>
<p class="translated">这不是苹果第一次限制其中国服务。2017 年，该公司<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/29/apple-removes-vpn-apps-from-the-app-store-in-china/">从其中国应用商店删除了数百个 VPN</a>，这是一种帮助当地互联网用户访问否则会被屏蔽的海外网站的工具，以遵守当地的互联网法律。去年的另一个重大举措是，苹果开始在本地存储其中国用户<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/apples-icloud-user-data-in-china-is-now-handled-by-a-state-owned-mobile-operator/">的数据，使得地方当局可以访问数字足迹的海洋。</a></p>
