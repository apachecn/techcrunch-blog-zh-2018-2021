<p class="translated">It’s been a pretty dismal past month for Huawei since the American government added it and 70 of its affiliates to an “entity list” which forbids U.S. companies from doing business with it. The ramifications of the move were huge across Huawei’s networking and consumer devices businesses. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230123120042/https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/several-chip-companies-including-qualcomm-and-intel-have-reportedly-stopped-supplying-huawei-after-blacklist/">A range of chip companies reportedly forced to sever ties</a> while Google, which provides Android for Huawei devices, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230123120042/https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/huawei-responds-android/">also froze its relationship</a>. Speaking this month.</p>
<p class="translated">All told, Huawei founder and chief executive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230123120042/https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/17/trade-war-costs-huawei-30-billion/">Ren Zhengfei said recently</a> that the ban would cost the Chinese tech firm — <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230123120042/https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS44826119">the world’s third-larger seller of smartphones</a> — some $30 billion in lost revenue of the next two years.</p>
<p class="translated">Now, however, the Trump administration has provided a reprieve, at least based on the President’s comments following a meeting with Chinese premier Xi Jinping at the G20 summit this weekend.</p>
<p class="translated">“US companies can sell their equipment to Huawei. We’re talking about equipment where there’s no great national security problem with it,” the U.S. President said.</p>
<p class="translated">Those comments perhaps contradict some in the US administration who saw the Huawei blacklisting as a way to strangle the company and its global ambitions, which are deemed by some analysts to be a threat to America.</p>
<p class="embed breakout">

</p>
<p class="translated">Despite the good news, any mutual trust has been broken and things are unlikely to be the same again.</p>
<p class="translated">America’s almost casual move to blacklist Huawei — the latest in a series of strategies in its ongoing trade battle with China — exemplifies just how dependent the company has become on the U.S. to simply function.</p>
<p class="translated">Huawei has taken steps to hedge its reliance on America, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230123120042/https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/14/huawei-has-built-an-android-alternative-in-case-us-tensions-increase/">the development of its own operating system to replace Android</a> and its own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230123120042/https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-huawei-tech-hisilicon/update-1-huaweis-hisilicon-says-it-has-long-been-preparing-for-us-ban-scenario-idUSL4N22T0J0">backup chips</a>, and you can expect that these projects will go into overdrive to ensure that Huawei doesn’t find itself in a similar position again in the future.</p>
<p class="translated">当然，从软件和组件的角度来看，将其供应链与美国合作伙伴脱钩绝非易事。华为是否能保持目前的业务水平仍有待观察，其中包括上个季度的 5900 万部智能手机和 2018 年的 1074 亿美元总收入的 T2，但这一事件提醒人们，华为必须有一个坚实的应急政策，以防未来再次成为政治棋子。</p>
<p class="translated">除了帮助华为，特朗普的举动还将促进谷歌和其他华为合作伙伴的发展，这些合作伙伴投入了大量时间和资源来发展与华为的关系，以通过华为的业务促进自己的业务。</p>
<p class="translated">事实上，特朗普在向媒体发表讲话时承认，美国公司向华为出售“大量”产品。一些人“对不能卖给华为不太高兴”，看起来这可能有助于扭转这一决定。但是，话说回来，永远不要说永远——你可能会认为，尽管出现了最新的转折，华为和特朗普的故事还远未结束。</p>
