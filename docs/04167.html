				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">明天是世界表情符号日。为什么会有世界表情符号日？不知道！但是是明天啊！</p>
<p class="translated">为了纪念这一天，苹果和谷歌都透露了一些关于未来几个月将在其操作系统中使用新表情符号的计划。两家公司总共增加了大约 60 个新的表情符号，从树懒和水獭等可爱的东西到重要的代表图标。</p>
<p class="translated">首先，两家公司都在修改他们的手拉手表情符号，这样你的表情符号用户就可以和你喜欢的任何人手拉手，无论性别或肤色。</p>

<p class="translated">谷歌还指出，从 Android Q 开始，任何没有在 Unicode 文档中指定性别的表情符号——如“警察”或“理发的人”等 51 种表情符号——现在都将默认为“性别模糊设计”如果你愿意，你可以按住表情符号来选择“男性”或“女性”演示。</p>
<p class="translated">这两个平台也将获得大量新的易访问性表情符号。苹果在去年早些时候提出了<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230326082252/https://blog.emojipedia.org/apple-proposes-new-accessibility-emojis/"/>，Unicode Consortium(决定官方表情集的组织)在今年二月给出了它的<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230326082252/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/02/05/apple-backed-emoji-people-disabilities-coming-soon/2782210002/">批准章。</a></p>
