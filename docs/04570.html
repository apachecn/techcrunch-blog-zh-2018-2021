<p class="translated">苹果首先在 2018 年 WWDC 车展上宣布了非接触式学生证计划，然后 T2 在去年 10 月首次在学校推出了 T3。</p>
<p class="translated">非接触式 id 不仅可以作为学生身份识别的手段，还可以作为校园交易的支付机制——例如，在自助餐厅吃饭或在大学书店购买教科书和用品。非接触式进入建筑物现在在大学校园也很常见，这些数字身份证也可以用来开门，作为刷卡进入卡的替代方案。</p>

<p class="translated">支持大学生 id 只是苹果试图取代实体钱包的一种方式。该公司还支持通过 Apple Pay Cash 添加您的借记卡和信用卡、交通卡和会员卡、门票甚至纸币的功能。现在<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230314074217/https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/apple-rolls-out-apple-card-preview-to-select-users/">它也推出了自己的信用卡</a>，为你购买苹果产品和使用 Apple Pay 提供现金回馈。</p>
<p class="translated">苹果互联网服务副总裁珍妮弗·贝利(Jennifer Bailey)在一份关于扩张的声明中表示，“我们很高兴加入越来越多的学校，这些学校让使用 iPhone 和 Apple Watch 在校园里走动变得比以往任何时候都更容易。”“我们知道学生喜欢这个功能。我们的大学合作伙伴告诉我们，自推出以来，全国各地的学生已经购买了 125 万份饭菜，并通过点击他们的 iPhone 和 Apple Watch 打开了超过 400 万扇门。”</p>
<p class="translated">与此次发布相关的是，苹果公司表示，它还将增加对 CBORD、Allegion 和 HID 的支持，这些是针对校园凭证和移动访问的解决方案提供商。有了这些技术，苹果将能够在未来接触到其他集成了这些系统的学校。</p>
