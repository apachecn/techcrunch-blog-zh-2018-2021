				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">沃尔沃正在调侃其即将推出的第一款全电动汽车，以及XC40 SUV的一些初步草图和一些细节。结果是:沃尔沃强调一种更简单的设计，摒弃了燃气汽车的一些特点。</p>
<p id="p_0" class="translated">例如，XC40 SUV不会有排气管。用于冷却燃气汽车的传统前格栅也不见了。然后是frunk——特斯拉电动汽车的前行李箱，以及其他一些最近加入的电动汽车。</p>
<p class="translated">目前，沃尔沃只是分享了这款新车的草图，它将于10月16日首次亮相。</p>
<p class="translated">注意，在下面的照片中，没有排气管。</p>

<p class="translated">这里有一个更详细的车辆前部看看。沃尔沃燃气汽车上的传统格栅不见了。</p>
<p class="translated">“不需要格栅，我们创造了一个更干净、更现代的面孔，而尾部没有排气管也同样如此。这是我们在电气化道路上不断探索的方法，”沃尔沃汽车设计主管罗宾·佩奇在一份伴随图片的声明中说。</p>

<p class="translated">沃尔沃透露了即将推出的电动SUV的更多细节。该车将有八种车身颜色，包括一种全新的“灰绿色”金属漆。标准配置是对比鲜明的黑色车顶。还将提供两种新的19英寸和20英寸车轮选项。</p>
<p id="p_13" class="translated">沃尔沃改变了SUV内部的驾驶员界面，以提供电池状态等相关信息。该公司表示，室内设计包的特点是运动风格的细节以及由回收材料制成的地毯。沃尔沃还强调了宽敞的内部空间，这在一定程度上归功于它所占据的额外空间，因为电池组被集成到了汽车的地板上。</p>
<p id="p_18" class="translated">该车在车门和座椅下包括更多的功能存储空间，一个用于小袋的折叠钩和一个位于隧道控制台的可移动垃圾箱。</p>
