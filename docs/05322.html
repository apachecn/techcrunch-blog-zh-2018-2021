<p class="translated">你可能还记得Orbit Fab这个名字，因为这家年轻的公司今年早些时候取得了一项里程碑式的成就:成为<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230129214346/https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/orbit-fab-becomes-first-startup-to-supply-water-to-iss-paving-the-way-for-satellite-refueling/">第一家向国际空间站</a>供水的初创公司，这本身就是一项成就，但也是其技术用于轨道卫星燃料补给的可行性的一次重要展示。给卫星加油可能会对商业卫星业务产生巨大影响，大大延长昂贵卫星的运行寿命，从而转化为更好的利润和更有利可图的业务。</p>
<p class="translated">感谢联合创始人Daniel Faber和Jeremy Schiel在航天行业的关系，他们在航天技术企业担任领导职务超过15年，该公司能够在Orbit Fab实际成立后不到一年的时间里展示其在太空中的技术。Faber是Orbit Fab的首席执行官，Schiel是这家初创公司的CMO，两人在深空工业公司工作时相识——Faber是首席执行官，Schiel是承包商。</p>

<p class="translated">Schiel在一次采访中说:“我们后来重新建立了联系，并真正研究了一些不同的商业模式，以推动该行业向前发展。”。“真正得到客户青睐、引起行业共鸣的是给卫星加油。埃隆(马斯克)一直在制造可重复使用的火箭——我们认为是时候让卫星也可重复使用了。”</p>
<p class="translated">从这一认识出发，两人于2018年1月成立了这家公司。同年6月，他们从旧金山的Bolt那里获得了第一轮种子前投资，并获得了两份合同——包括一份与美国宇航局的合同，一份与国际空间站国家实验室的合同。</p>
<p class="translated">“基本上在四个半月内，我们从美国宇航局获得了飞行资格和人类评级，我们的两个加油机试验台于2018年12月和2019年3月飞往国际空间站，”Shield说。</p>
<p class="translated">他们是如何以那样的速度做到的？Faber将他们的快速进展主要归功于首席工程师James Bultitude，他是一名出色的太空工程师，已经在国际空间站上安装了五个有效载荷。</p>
<p class="translated">“他在四个半月的时间里将[这个项目]从一张餐巾纸发展到飞行硬件，”费伯说。“所有都符合美国国家航空航天局的人类安全标准，这是相当了不起的成就。我们真的不得不对NASA施加压力。”</p>

<p class="translated">Faber表示，该公司促使美国航天局采取行动的能力是其成功的关键驱动力。事实上，他转述了一个故事，其中他们的国家实验室演示有效载荷实际上偏离了预定的飞行，但该团队能够在一个周末的过程中让其货物获得美国宇航局高层决策者的批准，结果只是勉强通过。</p>
<p class="translated">至于作为一家初创公司与NASA合作，Faber表示，这已经成为一件非常不同的事情，该机构渴望并适应与更年轻的公司和初创公司合作，为该领域带来不同的创新步伐。</p>
<p class="translated">“在与美国宇航局的电话中，这种变化几乎是显而易见的——你几乎可以听到他们在改变，”他说。</p>
<p class="translated">在Disrupt上，Orbit Fab首次在舞台上展示了他们用于加油的机器人连接器。这个想法是，卫星制造商将在他们的设计中建立他们的标准喷嘴，然后机器人加油器将能够找到喷嘴，打开然后关闭耦合器，形成一个牢固的连接，允许推进剂转移。</p>
<p class="translated">Orbit Fab已经在与包括诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司在内的合作伙伴进行谈判，并且它是执行会合与服务操作联盟(Operations)的成员，该行业组织旨在使卫星的机器人服务和维护成为可行的现实。</p>
