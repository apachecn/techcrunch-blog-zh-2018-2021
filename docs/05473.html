class="translated">总部位于首尔的教育科技初创公司<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230203075413/https://qanda.ai/"> Mathpresso </a>今天宣布，它已经筹集了 1450 万美元的 B 轮融资。该公司的旗舰应用程序是 Qanda，它为学生提供数学和科学帮助和辅导。该轮参与者包括联想资本、InterVest、NP Investments 和 Mirae Asset Venture Investment。</p>
<p class="translated">这使得 Mathpresso 迄今为止的资金总额达到 2120 万美元。它的上一轮融资是去年底宣布的 530 万美元的 A 轮融资。</p>
<p class="translated">Mathpresso 表示，目前韩国有三分之一的学生使用 Qanda(这个名字代表“Q 和 A”)。这款应用去年在日本、越南、印度尼西亚和新加坡等市场推出，目前在 50 多个国家拥有用户。Qanda 使用基于人工智能的光学字符识别来扫描数学问题。学生们拍下一个问题的照片，然后上传，从应用程序或导师那里获得解决问题的指导。</p>
<p class="translated">在一份声明中，联想资本董事总经理朴成表示:“作为中国领先的移动教育公司如作业帮和洋葱数学的早期投资者，联想资本见证了中国移动教育市场的强劲增长。我们坚信 Mathpresso 拥有向海外扩张的技术和运营能力，能够抓住教育数字化带来的新机遇，例如为每个学生提供个性化学习。”</p>
