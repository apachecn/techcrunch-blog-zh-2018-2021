<h1 class="translated">抖音新推出的一套安全视频向用户介绍了这款应用的功能，以及它对“积极性”的关注</h1>

				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">抖音今天<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/youre-in-control-video-series-stars-tiktok-creators-to-educate-users-about-safety-features">发布了</a>一组新的<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktoktips">安全视频</a>，旨在开玩笑地告知用户该应用的隐私控制和其他功能——比如如何过滤评论或报告不当行为等。一个视频还提到了抖音创造一个“积极的”社交媒体环境的目标，在这个环境中，创造力被颂扬，骚扰被禁止。</p>
<p class="translated">每当这家总部位于北京的公司就该应用的审查活动受到压力时，这种特殊的价值观——抖音是为了“好玩”——就会被引用。今天，抖音隐藏在声称这是一个轻松、积极行为的地方。但实际上，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/15/tiktoks-beijing-roots-fuel-censorship-suspicion-it-builds-huge-us-audience/">中国不想让其公民知道的审查话题</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing"/>——比如香港抗议。与此同时，它似乎没有在美国的政治问题上采取行动，在美国，#dumptrump或#maga等标签拥有数百万的浏览量。</p>
<p class="translated">为了找到自己的中庸之道，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/tiktok-taps-corporate-law-firm-kl-gates-to-advise-on-its-u-s-content-moderation-policies/">抖音最近聘请了K &amp; L Gates </a>公司律师事务所，就如何制定不被美国监管机构发现的政策提供建议。</p>
<p class="translated">与此同时，抖音正在着手通过这些有教育意义的视频打造它想要的那种社区。但它不只是自上而下地发布命令——抖音与自己的创作者合作，参与视频，然后向粉丝推广。例如，第一组视频<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/tiktok-is-launching-a-series-of-online-safety-videos-in-its-app/">在二月</a>发布，展示了十几个抖音的创作者。</p>
<p class="translated">这一次，公司又拉来了十几个，包括:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/@nathanpiland" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> @nathanpiland </a>，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/@d_damodel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> @d_damodel </a>，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/@juniortvine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> @juniortvine </a>，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/@Stevenmckell" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> @Stevenmckell </a>，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/@supershaund" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> @supershaund </a>，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/@ourfire?langCountry=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> @ourfire </a>，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/@thedawndishsoap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@ the dawdnissoap</a>，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/@katjaglieson" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> @katjaglieson </a>，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/@mahoganylox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> @mahoganylox【等等</a></p>
<p class="translated">与Twitter、脸书或Instagram相比，这是一种非常不同的社区设置方式。这些平台花了数年时间才解决了用户对隐私、<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/instagram-will-give-you-more-control-over-your-third-party-apps-in-about-six-months/">安全</a>和防骚扰功能的基本需求，如<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/instagram-now-lets-everyone-filter-comments-using-blocklists-will-show-friends-comments-first/">过滤</a>评论、屏蔽<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/22/instagram-now-lets-you-mute-accounts/">静音</a>等等。与此同时，社交媒体成了网络流氓和虐待者的天堂。</p>
<p class="translated">TikTok is approaching the problem from a different standpoint — by consciously creating a community where users are knowledgable and feel empowered to kick out the bad elements from disrupting their fun.</p>
<p class="translated">The only problem is that TikTok’s definition of what’s “fun” and appropriate has a political bent.</p>
<p class="translated">Creativity and art aren’t only meant for expressing positive sentiments. And given that TikTok was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/rubio-asks-us-to-investigate-china-based-tiktok-for-censorship.html">enforcing China’s censorship of topics </a>like Tiananmen Square, Hong Kong and Taiwan to its more than 500 million global monthly users, it wouldn’t be a leap to find the company one day censoring all sorts of political speech and other social issues — effectively becoming a tool for China to spread its government’s views to the wider world. And that’s far less fun.</p>
<p class="translated">TikTok reiterated its comment that U.S. moderation is handled by a U.S. team:</p>
<blockquote><p class="translated">Our content and moderation policies are led by our US-based team and are not influenced by any foreign government. The Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content, and would not have jurisdiction regardless, as TikTok does not operate there. To be clear: We do not remove videos based on the presence of Hong Kong protest content.</p></blockquote>
<p class="translated">We and others had searched Hong Kong and related hashtags prior to today in the app and found, as The Washington Post did, “barely a hint of unrest in sight.” TikTok says several hashtags will now show that sort of content, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/tag/freehongkong?language=en&amp;name=&amp;u_code=d3ab98ghd3466l&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;app=musically&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;user_id=6628217261612843014&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;enter_from=h5_m">#freehongkong</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222021937/https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hongkongprotest?language=en&amp;name=&amp;u_code=d3ab98ghd3466l&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;app=musically&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;user_id=6628217261612843014&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;enter_from=h5_m">#hongkongprotest, </a>for example. But these two have views in the tens of thousands. Meanwhile, U.S. political hashtags have hundreds of millions of views, by comparison… as most high-profile topics do.</p>
