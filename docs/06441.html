<p class="p1 translated"><span class="s1">大约一个月前，在消费电子展上亮相几年后，这个友好的小机器人终于在日本国内上市了。这是一长串旨在安慰孤独者的“机器人”中的最新一个——名单中包括像艾博这样的著名名字。尽管如此，这家成立四年的初创公司坚持认为，其模型比标志性的机器狗更先进，具有大约50个机载传感器和多个CPU(包括一个机载充电底座)。</span></p>

<p class="p1 translated">我不打算假装在这个CES前活动的地板上与机器人相处了几分钟，这真的让我熟悉了Lovot的微妙细节，但我对陌生人的速度印象深刻。在这样一个混乱的环境中，这给人留下了特别深刻的印象。这是一个大胆的小机器人，不怕接近陌生人，与我们在艾博的经历大相径庭，这肯定会让你为它工作。</p>
<p class="p1 translated"><span class="s1">像艾博一样，Lovot的设计是随着时间的推移而变暖，学习主人的面孔，当他们回家时打招呼等等。长满青苔的布料肯定比艾博更温暖，更令人想拥抱，而且机器人不会回避一个好的拥抱。</span></p>

<p class="p1 translated">至于在美国上市的可能性，你和我都猜得到。该公司的创始人兼首席执行官朝日奈要·哈亚希告诉我，“如果我们能找到一个投资者，那么我们很可能会来美国。”这很合理，尽管美国消费者还没有真正证明自己对昂贵的家用机器人类别感兴趣。</p>
