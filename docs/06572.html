				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">2019 年，消费者下载了创纪录的 2040 亿个应用程序，比 2018 年增长 6%，自 2016 年以来增长 45%，过去一年在应用程序、订阅和其他应用内支出上花费了 1200 亿美元。与此同时，普通移动用户每天花 3.7 个小时使用应用程序。这些数据和更多数据来自于<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221217054729/https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/state-of-mobile-2020-infographic/"> App Annie 的年度报告《移动状态》(State of Mobile)</a>，该报告强调了过去一年最大的应用趋势，并设定了未来几年的预测。</p>
<p class="translated">根据 App Annie 的数据，2019 年移动下载量的创纪录增长可归因于印度、巴西和印度尼西亚等新兴市场的增长，自 2016 年以来，这些国家的下载量分别飙升了 190%、40%和 70%。与此同时，同期美国的下载量增速放缓至仅 5%，而中国则增长了 80%。</p>

<p class="translated">这并不意味着成熟市场的用户不下载应用程序，只是意味着年同比下载量的增长开始趋于平稳。尽管如此，这些更成熟的市场继续出现大量安装，2019 年美国的下载量超过 123 亿次，日本为 25 亿次，韩国为 20 亿次。</p>
<p class="translated">鉴于 App Annie 的分析不包括重新安装和应用程序更新，这些创纪录的数字也值得注意。</p>
<p class="translated">2019 年，应用商店消费者支出也在增加，在应用上的支出为 1200 亿美元，比 2016 年增长了 2.1 倍。游戏仍然占支出的大部分(72%)，但向订阅的转变也发挥了作用。去年，非游戏应用的订阅占消费者支出的 28%，高于 2016 年的 18%。</p>
<p class="translated">订阅现在是许多非游戏应用创收的主要方式。例如，美国前 250 名 iOS 应用程序中 97%的消费者支出是由订阅驱动的，94%的应用程序使用订阅。在 Google Play 上，91%的消费者支出是基于订阅的，而前 250 名应用中有 79%使用订阅。</p>
<p class="translated">特别是，由于订阅收入，Tinder 等约会应用程序和网飞和腾讯视频等视频应用程序在 2019 年的消费者支出排行榜上名列榜首。</p>

<p class="translated">App Annie 发现，包括美国、日本、韩国和英国在内的成熟市场正在推动消费者在游戏和订阅方面的支出。但中国仍是最大的市场，占全球支出的 40%。</p>

<p class="translated">该报告还确定了 2019 年的几个移动趋势，包括移动应用程序与物联网和智能家居设备的连接(去年 20 大物联网应用程序的下载量为 1.06 亿次)；Z 世代巨大的移动参与度(每个应用每月 3.8 小时，在 avgerage 上的前 25 个非游戏应用中)；以及移动广告支出的增长(2019 年 1900 亿美元到 2020 年 2400 亿美元)。</p>

<p class="translated">App Annie 预测，到 2020 年，全球广告支出和消费者支出预计将达到 3800 亿美元。</p>
<p class="translated">鉴于游戏对消费者支出的贡献，它获得了一个大的突破部分。</p>
<p class="translated">消费者在移动游戏上的支出是 Mac/PC 游戏的 2.4 倍，是游戏机的 2.9 倍。2019 年，移动游戏的支出比所有其他游戏多 25%，预计明年所有应用商店的支出将超过 1000 亿美元。</p>

<p class="translated">休闲游戏(以拼图和街机为首)是 2019 年下载最多的游戏类型。同时，核心游戏(如动作、RPG 等。)——仅占下载量的 18%——却占据了顶级游戏花费时间的 55%。从花费的时间来看，PUBG Mobile 是 2019 年 Android 上排名第一的核心游戏(动作)，而 Anipop(益智)是排名第一的休闲游戏。</p>

<p class="translated">2019 年，消费者支出超过 500 万美元的游戏比 2017 年增加了 17%。与两年前相比，收入超过 1 亿美元的游戏数量增长了 59%。尽管收入增长可观，但 App Annie 也指出了移动游戏的新模式，如 Apple Arcade，这给了其他类型的游戏蓬勃发展的机会。不幸的是，没有第三方公司能够跟踪街机收入，这将成为 App Annie 在未来几年的一个明显盲点。</p>

<p class="translated">App Annie 还研究了移动市场的其他相当大的细分市场的趋势，包括金融科技、零售、流媒体和社交。一些更重要的发现包括:金融科技应用的用户群增长超过传统银行应用；购物应用下载量同比增长 20%，达到 54 亿次；与 2017 年相比，2019 年的流媒体增长包括 50%的会话；花在手机上的时间有 50%花在了社交网络和通讯应用上。</p>
<p class="translated">鉴于抖音去年的快速发展，它受到了特别的关注。2019 年，全球花在短格式视频应用上的时间同比增长 210%。App Annie 表示，尽管在抖音花费的每 10 分钟中有 8 分钟是由中国用户使用的，但该应用在其他市场的使用也在飙升。</p>
