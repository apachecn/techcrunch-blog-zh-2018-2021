<p class="translated">谷歌将流量整合到其核心领域的举措增加了 google.com 的流量；YouTube 也在成长。然而，脸书的麻烦也反映在它的数字上，仅在过去一年就损失了 8.6%的流量。该报告推测，其损失的部分流量流向了 YouTube，这可能是脸书近年来更加重视视频的原因。也就是说，脸书在移动领域的投资帮助其在其他领域发展 Instagram 和 WhatsApp 的网络流量同比增长了 74%。</p>
<p class="translated">同样下降的还有雅虎，其 2017 年的流量下降了 33.6%，以及 Tumblr，其在 2018 年禁止了成人网站，导致流量下降了 33%。</p>
<p class="translated">脸书在 2019 年通过重新吸引现有用户来应对网络流量下降和相关的应用程序使用量下降，这帮助它增加了全年的应用程序会话总数。YouTube 使用类似的策略来增加自己的应用程序参与数字，导致两者在这一指标上接近。</p>
