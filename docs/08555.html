				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">China is showing renewed interest in live streaming. As the coronavirus swept through the country and shut down premises in droves, businesses are turning online to drive sales. Many have adopted live streaming, a model that predates the short videos that dominate many of our mobile screens now. Ecommerce titans like Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo have ramped up efforts in live streaming, which sees customers interact with merchants and place orders in real time as many continue to avoid offline shopping.</p>
<p class="translated">An unorthodox player, WeChat, has also entered the fray.</p>
<p class="translated">The messaging giant, which commands 1.16 monthly active users, announced this week it’s partnering with the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou to host a live stream shopping festival in June. The news arrived not long after president Xi Jinping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230131023942/https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202005/06/WS5eb21c5ca310a8b241153932.html">acknowledged</a> the essential role of live streaming ecommerce in the economy, especially in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230131023942/https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/06/1001186/china-rural-live-streaming-during-cornavirus-pandemic/">promoting sales of rural produce</a>.</p>
<p class="translated">The initiative led by a municipal government to pump up the local economy through live streaming ecommerce is first of its kind in China. It should surprise no one that it’s slated to take place in Guangzhou, a major trade and export center, as the global pandemic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230131023942/https://in.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-trade/chinas-trade-slump-eases-in-march-but-pandemic-set-to-deepen-export-downturn-idINKCN21W0BU">depressed China’s outbound shipments,</a> putting pressure on the authority to stimulate domestic demand.</p>
<p class="translated">Like most of WeChat’s extended functions beyond messaging, live streaming is built upon the mini program — or lite app — infrastructure. The feature now sees registered merchants in the several tens of thousands and remains free to use during the testing phase, according to WeChat. Retailers in grocery, tourism and fashion are by far the biggest beneficiaries. Nasdaq-listed travel portal Ctrip, for example, has racked up nearly 100 million yuan, or $14 million, in sales by promoting live on WeChat as airlines and tourist attractions are shelling out deep discounts. H<span>omegrown lifestyle brand Heilan Home recorded more than 3 million viewers in one live session. </span></p>
<p class="translated">“In recent months, the demand for online shopping has surged due to the coronavirus pandemic. Selling through live streams is now a key way to help businesses reopen and resume production as well as stimulate consumer demand,” Gerald Hu, general manager of Tencent Guangzhou, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="translated">微信晚来了直播。尽管围绕该领域进行了多年的宣传，但这家社交网络巨头直到今年 2 月才正式将直播引入其一体化平台。这在一定程度上可能是创始人张海星对产品的极简主义和完美主义态度的结果。</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"/>
<p class="translated">毕竟微信的核心是方便熟人之间的交流。购物和游戏等其他功能是社交体验的延伸，旨在补充而不是阻碍聊天。人们可能会通过微信消息购买朋友与他们分享的零食，或者接受朋友的邀请加入微信上的应用内游戏，但有多少人愿意花 30 分钟专注于一个视频，并冒着错过重要消息的风险？</p>
