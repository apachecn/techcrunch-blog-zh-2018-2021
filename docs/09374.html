<p class="translated">由<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230406162226/https://ff.co/"> Founders Forum </a>和 TechCrunch 联合进行的一项独家调查发现，63%的受访者表示，他们只会在 1-3 个月或 3-6 个月内重新开业——即使政府建议在此之前开业是安全的。少数人重开了他们的办公室，而 10%的人永久关闭了他们的办公室。完整的调查结果<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230406162226/https://foundersforumlive.typeform.com/report/LIVEny/8UGJfvf0idnikmTO">可以在这里找到</a>。</p>
<p class="translated">然而，这显然将对办公室工作模式产生长期影响，大多数受访者表示，他们现在将转向灵活的远程工作模式(一些人有永久办公室，一些人没有)，但只有一小部分人计划“正常”重返工作岗位。极少数人计划完全“远离”许多人提到，在尝试建立团队文化时，面对面的互动会带来持续的好处，这对于初创公司至关重要。</p>
<p class="translated"><strong>疫情大规模关闭办公室</strong> <br/>参与调查的 328 人中，84%的人说他们在新冠肺炎疫情期间关闭了办公室；5%的人说他们没有；8%的人表示不适用(即没有要关闭的办公室)。大多数回答的人处于种子期或种子前期阶段，少数人已经过了首轮融资阶段。</p>

<p class="translated">该调查由 TechCrunch 和英国非营利组织<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230406162226/https://ff.co/">创始人论坛</a>发起，旨在评估随着全球新冠肺炎疫情对办公室工作的影响以及向“在家工作”政策的转变，初创公司未来将如何工作。在 328 个回答中，61%来自英国，20%来自美国，其余来自其他国家。</p>
<h2 data-amp-original-style="text-align: left;" class="amp-wp-102b7f8 translated">“缺少面对面解决问题和建立团队的力量”</h2>
<p class="translated">发起这项研究的创始人论坛(Founders Forum)的布伦特·霍伯曼(Brent Hoberman)对研究结果评论道:“研究结果证明，早期科技创始人适应性强，企业家精神是最适合远程工作的职业之一。大多数早期创始人在此期间没有看到生产率受到冲击，但长期来看，创意产出、团队文化和培训会发生什么变化，还有待观察。此外，更灵活的新型共享社交工作空间显然还有机会，绝大多数受访者仍然认为面对面互动有价值。”</p>
<p class="translated"><strong>远程工作提高了生产率，但影响了文化</strong> <br/>新冠肺炎期间的远程工作似乎没有影响产量，55%的初创公司表示他们比平时工作得更多，30%的人工作时间相同，但少了 13%。</p>
