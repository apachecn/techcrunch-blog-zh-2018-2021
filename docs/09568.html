<p class="translated">最后一部分可能有点令人惊讶，因为微软和 Asobo 正在使用 Bing 地图的资产和 Azure 上的一些人工智能魔法，在《飞行模拟器 2020》中基本上重现了地球及其所有机场。不过，该团队肯定花了一些额外的时间来使这些大型机场变得特别逼真，今天，如果你想购买这些大型机场中的一个作为飞行模拟器 X 或 X-Plane 的附加设备，你很容易就会花费 30 美元或更多。</p>

<p class="translated">默认版有 20 架飞机和 30 个手工模型机场，而豪华版有多达 25 架飞机和 35 个机场，高端版有 30 架飞机和 40 个机场。</p>
<p class="translated">在这些机场中，没有在默认版本中模拟出所有辉煌的细节(顺便说一下，它们仍然存在，只是没有一些额外的细节)，如阿姆斯特丹史基浦机场、芝加哥奥黑尔机场、丹佛机场、法兰克福机场、希思罗机场和旧金山机场。</p>

<p class="translated">飞机也是如此，例如，787 只提供豪华套餐。尽管如此，根据 Asobo 迄今为止在其定期更新中显示的内容，即使是标准版中的 20 架飞机，其建模也比以前的版本更加详细，甚至可能超过今天一些附加组件提供的内容。</p>

<p class="translated">因为微软和 Adobo 在这里做的很多事情都涉及到使用云技术，例如，根据需要将一些更详细的风景传输到你的计算机上，所以我们有可能也会看到这些不同版本的定期内容更新，尽管这里的细节尚不清楚。</p>
<p class="translated">“无论你选择哪个版本，你的飞机队和详细的机场都可以在发布日获得，并可以获得持续的内容更新，这些内容更新将不断发展和扩展飞行模拟平台，”这是微软目前对此的说法。</p>
