<p class="translated">苹果、埃隆·马斯克和乔·拜登的账户在一次广泛针对性的黑客攻击中受损，攻击发生几小时后仍保持神秘。这些账户和许多其他账户发布了一条消息，宣传比特币钱包的地址，声称向该地址支付的任何款项都将翻倍并发回——这是一种已知的加密货币诈骗技术。</p>
<p class="translated">在最初的骗局发布后的几个小时内，金·卡戴珊·韦斯特、杰夫·贝索斯、比尔·盖茨、巴拉克·奥巴马、维兹·卡利法、沃伦·巴菲特、YouTuber MrBeast、温迪、优步、CashApp 和迈克·彭博也发布了加密货币骗局。</p>

<p class="translated">虽然我们仍在了解黑客攻击的更多细节，但我们可以报告，黑客<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127094404/https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/twitter-hacker-admin-scam/">利用内部 Twitter 管理工具</a>获得了高调账户的访问权限。该报道很快得到了<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127094404/https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283591846464233474">推特自己关于所发生事件的</a>的证实。周三晚上，该公司在推特上表示，针对员工的“协同社会工程攻击”让黑客“获得了内部系统和工具的访问权限。”</p>
<p class="embed breakout">

</p>

<p class="translated">在事件的范围变得清晰之前，黑客似乎专注于以加密货币为主的账户。在第一波诈骗帖子中，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127094404/https://twitter.com/Bitcoin">@比特币</a>，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127094404/https://twitter.com/Ripple/"> @ripple </a>，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127094404/https://twitter.com/coindesk"> @coindesk </a>，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127094404/https://twitter.com/coinbase"> @coinbase </a>和<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127094404/https://twitter.com/binance">@币安</a>被黑客攻击，内容相同:“我们与 CryptoForHealth 合作，向社区返还 5000 BTC，”后面是一个网站的链接。</p>
<p class="translated">链接的网站很快被下线。骗子使用的域名注册商 Namesilo 的首席执行官 Kristaps Ronka 告诉 TechCrunch，该公司“在收到第一份报告后”暂停了该域名。随着事件的发展，被黑客攻击的账户转移到共享多个比特币钱包地址，这使得事情更加难以追踪。</p>
<p class="translated">Twitter 在太平洋时间周三下午 2 点 45 分首次承认了这一情况，称这是一起“安全事件”</p>
<p class="embed breakout">

</p>
<p class="translated">起初，由于推文很快被删除，一些受影响的账户似乎回到了所有者的控制之下。但随后，埃隆·马斯克的账户在他最初关于骗局的推文被删除后发了一条“嗨”的推文。“嗨”的推文也消失了。<span class="c-message__edited_label" dir="ltr" data-sk="tooltip_parent" aria-describedby="sk-tooltip-4811"> </span></p>
<p class="translated">Twitter 用户报告说，随着情况的发展，他们在平台上看到了错误信息。TechCrunch 记者 Natasha Mascarenhas 在尝试创建主题推文时看到了这个错误(见下文)。TechCrunch 记者莎拉·佩雷斯(Sarah Perez)在试图发布一条普通推文时看到了类似的错误。两人都有经过核实的账户。</p>

<h3 class="translated">不寻常的黑客，普通的骗局</h3>
<p class="translated">虽然周三 Twitter 黑客攻击的范围在社交网络上是前所未有的，但被黑客攻击的账户推广的诈骗类型是常见的。骗子使用被攻破或泄露的密码接管备受瞩目的 Twitter 账户，并发布消息，鼓励用户在他们将加倍“投资”的幌子下将他们的加密货币资金张贴到特定地址。在现实中，这是简单的盗窃，但这是一个行之有效的骗局。</p>
<p class="translated">诈骗网站上使用的主要区块链地址已经收集了超过 12.5 个比特币——约 116，000 美元——并且每分钟都在增加。</p>
<p class="translated">币安的一名发言人告诉 TechCrunch:“安全团队正在积极调查这起针对密码行业的协同攻击的情况。”受到账户被黑影响的其他几家公司没有立即回应置评请求。</p>
<p class="translated">目前还不清楚账户被黑是如何发生的。然而，安全研究人员发现，攻击者已经完全接管了受害者的账户，还改变了与账户相关的电子邮件地址，使真实用户更难重新获得访问权限。</p>
<p class="translated">骗子经常回复名人和公众人物等高调的账户，以劫持对话并欺骗不知情的受害者。Twitter 通常会很快关闭这些账户。</p>
<p class="translated">当联系到 Twitter 发言人时，他表示公司正在“调查”此事，但没有立即置评。</p>
<p class="translated"><em>这个故事正在发展。敬请关注更新。</em></p>
