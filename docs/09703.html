				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">The Jack Ma-controlled Ant Group finally sets in motion what the market has been anticipating for years. The financial services and payments behemoth said Monday that it has kickstarted the process of a concurrent initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange’s Nasdaq-style Star Market.</p>
<p class="translated">The public listing will enable Ant, which operates the Alipay wallet used across Alibaba’s e-commerce networks, to work toward several goals: digitize China’s service industry, such as getting mom and pop shops in far-flung regions to use its payments service; drive domestic demands, such as being a conduit of government-issued coupons for consumers amid coronavirus pandemic; expand globally through its e-wallet partners in nine countries; and finally, invest in new technologies.</p>
<p class="translated">Ant’s choice of the HKSE and Star Market follows the latest trend of Chinese tech firms trading closer to home as the cities make it easier for high-risk, innovation-driven firms to access funding. The Star exchange, first unveiled by President Xi Jinping, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328130123/https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/china-new-tech-board/">debuted</a> last year as Xi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328130123/https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/chinese-tech-firms-get-new-exchange-shanghai/">called for</a> China to be technologically independent.</p>
<p class="translated">The two markets have “opened the doors for global investors to access leading-edge technology companies from the most dynamic economies in the world and for those companies to have greater access to the capital markets. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to play a part in this development,” said Eric Jing, executive chairman of Ant Group, in a statement.</p>
<p class="translated">Bankers are valuing Ant at a staggering $200 billion, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328130123/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ant-financial-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-alibabas-ant-plans-hong-kong-ipo-targets-valuation-over-200-billion-sources-say-idUSKBN2491JU">sources</a> from Reuters. The company declined to comment on its valuation.</p>
<p class="translated">The firm recently dropped its old brand “Ant Financial” for “Ant Group” to scale back its focus on in-house financial products. Indeed, a recent filing from Alibaba, which holds 33% in Ant, showed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328130123/https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/ant-alibaba-1-3-billion-users/">about half of Ant’s 2019 revenues</a> came from technological infrastructure it provided to enterprise clients rather than proprietary financial products.</p>
<p class="translated">支付宝现在声称在世界各地拥有13亿用户，多年来已经从一个单纯的支付应用程序扩展到小额贷款和保险等第三方金融产品的在线门户。该应用程序还支持一系列日常服务，如星巴克会员和远程医疗，这些都由迷你应用程序提供支持，就像微信已经从一个信使发展成为一个全方位的服务平台。</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"/>
