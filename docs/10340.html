<p class="translated">Neuralink 的机器人具有干净的白色(确保无菌所必需的)，弧线和光滑的表面，看起来立即标志着其先进的技术能力，但也包含一些舒缓和更容易接近的元素，这是明智的，考虑到机器打算做什么。</p>
<p class="translated">该公司在一份新闻稿中解释说:“虽然病人可能不会醒着看到机器在运行，但设计一个无所畏惧的机器人仍然很重要，它可以在美学上与马斯克产品组合中的标志性机器共存。”“它还需要满足无菌和维护方面的一系列医疗要求，并为其操作人员提供安全无缝的使用。”</p>

<p class="translated">沃克表示，Neuralink 手术机器人可以分为三个主要部分:头部、身体和底座。机器人的头部是头盔状的部分，它实际上支撑着病人的头部。它还包括手术针的指南，以及嵌入的相机和传感器，以绘制病人的大脑。这件作品的设计意图，包括一个薄荷色的内部，是为了给机器人“一个人形特征”，有助于从手术的侵入性转移注意力。也有一次性使用的袋子，内衬在头盔内部，用于无菌操作。</p>
