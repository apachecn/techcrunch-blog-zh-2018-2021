<p class="translated">这东西充电足够快，设备锁定良好。它的手表充电部分感觉最优质的光滑小铬铰链。MagSafe Pad 和手表充电器是苹果公司典型的抛光铝，整个东西都有相当大的重量。值得一提的是，我无法测试它是否可以用 20W 的电源适配器同时为 Apple Watch 和 iPhone 快速充电。我会试着用这些信息更新这篇评论。</p>
<p class="translated">当然，因为 iPhone 的侧面是有磁性的，所以你确实可以获得 MagSafe 的好处，如果手机是连接着的，你就可以拿起手机，但当它是一大捆充电器时，相比之下，当它是手机背面的一个细长的 MagSafe 圆盘时，这就更尴尬了。也许在你的旅馆里做一个快速警报检查是好的。</p>

<p class="translated"><span data-amp-original-style="font-weight: 400;" class="amp-wp-fe3f5cc">但很抱歉，在空中力量的大肆宣传及其最终消亡之后，我觉得整件事有点乏味。苹果很可能一直在计划这件事，试图让 AirPower 发生，但这个故事在这个设备上着陆的弧线确实是悲伤的长号。</span></p>
<p class="translated"><span data-amp-original-style="font-weight: 400;" class="amp-wp-fe3f5cc">mag safe 二人组确实有效，而且有几个工程亮点。但是，当你购买 129 美元的充电器和 19 美元的 20W 电源块时，你会觉得不值这个钱，市场上有许多第三方配件可以很好地完成这项工作。</span></p>
