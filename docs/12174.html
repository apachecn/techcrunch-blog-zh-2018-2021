class="translated"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230322230415/https://www.carsome.my/">自称为东南亚最大的二手车电子商务平台的 Carsome </a>宣布完成了一笔 3000 万美元的 d 轮融资。这笔融资由亚洲伙伴(Asia Partners)领投，回归投资者布尔达本金投资公司和 Ondine Capital 参与其中。</p>
<p class="translated">这家初创公司将此描述为“东南亚在线汽车行业迄今为止最大的全股权融资”之一。D 系列的一部分可能用于合并和收购，以巩固公司的供应链。</p>
<p class="translated">Carsome 于五年前在马来西亚成立，其平台服务于 C2C 和 B2C 市场，并通过在车辆上市前进行检查来确保质量。它现在有 1000 名员工，并声称每年交易 7 万辆汽车，总额达 6 亿美元。</p>
<p class="translated">在一份新闻声明中，联合创始人兼集团首席执行官郑启泰表示，该公司现在还在印度尼西亚、泰国和新加坡开展业务，与疫情之前的水平相比，过去六个月的月收入翻了一番。该公司表示，这部分是因为越来越多的人和企业出于安全原因购买自己的汽车。</p>
<p class="translated">Counterpoint Research 称，尽管全球新车销量直线下降，但二手车销售，尤其是通过电子商务平台的销售，正在更快地复苏。这在很大程度上是因为人们希望避免公共交通和打车，但也希望有更便宜的选择。</p>
<p class="translated">东南亚的其他二手车平台包括 Carro、OLX 汽车(以前叫 BeliMobilGue)和 Carmudi。</p>
