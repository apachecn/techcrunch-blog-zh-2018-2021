<p class="translated">现在，它终于揭开了多年努力的面纱。今年早些时候被亚马逊收购的 Zoox 展示了它从头开始建造的电动自主机器人 robotaxi 这是一种装载传感器的立方体状车辆，没有方向盘和天窗，能够以每小时 75 英里的速度运送四个人。该车可以双向驾驶，并具有四轮转向功能，Zoox 表示，这些功能使其能够在紧凑的空间内机动，无需倒车即可改变方向。换句话说，密集的城市环境。</p>
<p class="translated">该车有四个座位，面对面对称的座位配置，类似于火车旅行者可能遇到的情况。它还配备了一个 133 千瓦时的电池，Zoox 说它可以在一次充电后连续工作 16 个小时。Zoox 没有提供电池的里程范围。</p>

<p class="translated">在车辆内部和周围还有其他设计好东西，包括双向车辆的安全气囊系统和包裹乘客的车厢座椅。Zoox 表示，这相当于所有四个座位的五星级碰撞安全保护。这辆车配备了摄像头、雷达和激光雷达，可以在车辆的四个角落提供 270 度的视野，Zoox 表示，这可以让它持续跟踪旁边和后面的物体，包括行人、骑自行车的人和其他道路使用者。</p>

<p class="translated">Zoox 首席技术官杰西·莱文森(Jesse Levinson)表示，从头开始制造车辆给了该公司一个重新想象乘客安全的机会，从被动措施转变为主动措施。“这些包括新的安全功能，如我们的安全气囊设计，整个汽车的冗余硬件，独特的传感器架构，以及检测和减轻潜在风险的定制人工智能堆栈，”莱文森说，并补充说，该车已通过关键的联邦机动车安全标准碰撞测试。</p>
<p class="translated">目前还不知道 Zoox 是否已经获得 FMVSS 的许可来运行车辆。这些联邦标准要求制造商制造具有特定特征的车辆，例如方向盘。Zoox 车辆没有，因为它被设计成自动驾驶。今年早些时候，自动送货初创公司 Nuro 成为第一家获得联邦政府无人驾驶豁免的公司。</p>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">美国交通部国家公路交通安全管理局授予的豁免是针对 Nuro 的新型低速电动汽车 R2，该汽车将用于餐馆，杂货店和其他企业的本地送货服务。虽然 Nuro 的车辆也没有方向盘，但它也是专为运送货物而设计的，而不是人。</p>

<p class="translated">尽管这是最后一个重要的监管障碍，但完成这款车对该公司来说是一个里程碑。Zoox 首席执行官艾莎·埃文斯(Aicha Evans)表示，这标志着该公司在部署自动叫车服务的征途上迈出了重要一步。</p>
<p class="translated">该公司在一封电子邮件中表示，Zoox 正在私人道路上测试这种专用车辆，然后将转移到公共道路上。“这是重要的一步，因为 Zoox 希望确保道路上的车辆已经过彻底的测试和审查，并准备好供公众使用，”该发言人在电子邮件中说。“Zoox 仍在推出商业打车服务的道路上。”</p>
<p class="translated">作为亚马逊独立子公司运营的 Zoox 目前正在拉斯维加斯、旧金山和福斯特城进行测试。根据埃文斯对彭博的采访，该公司打算处理 robotaxi 服务的所有方面，最终可能扩展到递送包裹。</p>
