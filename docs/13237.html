				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">Thousands of Chinese users suddenly found themselves unable to access Clubhouse on early Monday evening as the country prepared to start the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Inside WeChat groups, Clubhouse users rushed to report the situation and help each other with ways to get back onto the red hot live audio app.</p>
<p class="translated">Audio drop-in startup Clubhouse was rapidly gaining steam in China, attracting a bevy of users early on to conversations on a wide range of topics. The app seemed likely to meet the fate of other U.S.-based apps and services, however — namely, a ban — and as of Monday, that indeed was what Clubhouse faces, as confirmed by TechCrunch. Users in China can no longer access the Clubhouse app, though the app’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230322210328/https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">website</a> remains unblocked. The app is unlikely to return, given how much its model would have to change to comply with Chinese internet regulation.</p>

<p class="translated">Clubhouse has faced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230322210328/https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-where-are-the-adults-in-the-clubhouse/">criticism at home in the U.S. for its lack of effective moderation and abuse-prevention practices</a>, so it’s hardly a surprise that it has fallen afoul of China’s rather more strict enforcement of measures designed to stifle the spread of information the government deems inappropriate for discussion. The app was also not officially available via Apple’s China App Store, though access to it and its audio rooms was, before today, freely available without the use of a VPN, provided a user had the app installed on their device.</p>
<p class="translated">The app was briefly available on China’s App Store following its global launch in September but was removed in October, TechCrunch previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230322210328/https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/will-the-clubhouse-model-work-in-china/">reported</a>. It’s unclear whether Clubhouse or Apple pulled the app.</p>
<p class="translated">“This is not Apple’s doing but surely they must be happy to get out of a tight spot, as the discussion will shift from Apple’s involvement in the removal from App Store to the blocking of servers by authorities,” said Benjamin Ismail, campaign and advocacy director at GreatFire.org, which monitors censorship in China.</p>
<p class="translated">As Clubhouse was not listed on the Chinese App Store, it’s unclear how many people from mainland China were on the platform. A room discussing the 1989 pro-democracy Tiananmen protest, a taboo topic in China, reached the maximum number of participants at 5,000 this afternoon prior to the ban. Another room focused on the same topic attracted more than 2,000 users.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"/>
<p class="translated">Greatfire.org告诉TechCrunch，俱乐部会所的API在北京时间周一晚上7点左右被屏蔽。一些用户在微信群内报告称，他们的中国手机号码再也收不到验证码，这为屏蔽程度提供了更多线索。许多中国用户注册了中国电话号码，这些号码与他们在中国的真实身份相关联，可以让警方更容易识别他们。</p>
<p class="translated">过去两周，Clubhouse在mainland China的一些社区人气飙升，包括初创企业、投资、学术或有海外背景的人。来自mainland China、香港和台湾的用户进行了罕见的跨境对话，而异想天开、戏谑的对话遍地开花。他们中的许多人都意识到这款应用在中国不会持续太久，因为该平台经常出现免费且经常带有政治色彩的辩论。会所客房标题为“会所将在中国持续多久”和“你是否被邀请使用会所喝茶？”吸引了大批观众。“喝茶”是被警察带走审问的委婉说法。</p>
<p class="translated">在禁令发布前几个小时，中国官方支持的报纸《环球时报》发表了一篇题为“中国大陆用户说，会所不是‘言论自由的天堂’”的文章，并引用了一些用户的话，称该应用是“反华”言论泛滥的平台。</p>
<p class="translated">正如TechCrunch上周六指出的那样，Clubhouse在此次关闭之前的早期成功已经推动了许多围绕嵌入式音频网络设计的本土替代产品的诞生。然而，Clubhouse在中国的受欢迎程度可能很难复制任何类似的努力——出于同样的原因，最初的应用程序本身现在在中国无法访问。</p>

<p class="translated">TechCrunch了解到，借助虚拟专用网(VPN)等强大的防火墙规避工具，mainland China的一些用户成功重新进入了俱乐部会所。一些功能可以在VPN关闭的情况下听到和说话，只要他们通过VPN进入房间。据TechCrunch此前报道，在美国和中国运营的Agora提供SDK，为Clubhouse的现场音频交互提供支持。</p>
