<p class="translated">在推出时，该功能将包括网飞喜剧目录中的短片，包括《神秘谋杀案》(Murder Mystery)等电影，《大嘴》(Big Mouth)等连续剧，《船员》(The Crew)等情景喜剧，以及凯文·哈特和黄阿丽等单口相声演员的片段。</p>
<p class="translated">网飞向 TechCrunch 证实，该功能将利用其完整的目录，而不仅仅是自己的原创节目。然而，该公司不能说在任何给定的时间里，新体验中会有多少个节目或电影。</p>

<p class="translated">“快笑”大量借鉴了抖音的格式，因为它的提要还具有全屏视频，你可以垂直滑动，并将参与按钮放在屏幕的右侧。这些按钮可以让你用“LOL”(哭/笑)表情符号对剪辑做出反应，或者通过 iMessage 或其他社交媒体应用程序(如 WhatsApp、Instagram、Snapchat 或 Twitter)分享它。您也可以立即开始观看该节目，或者通过将它添加到“我的列表”来保存它以供以后观看</p>
<p class="translated">在测试中，“快速笑”片段的长度从 15 秒到 45 秒不等。今天，网飞说这些视频片段没有确切的长度。</p>
<p class="translated">因为剪辑的内容可能不适合儿童，“快笑”标签不会出现在网飞儿童的个人资料中。此外，成员将能够根据他们自己的成熟度等级设置来过滤内容。</p>

<p class="translated">该公司将该功能定位为发现工具。</p>
<p class="translated">“我们希望给会员一种有趣、快速、直观的方式来发现我们的产品目录，让这些跨流派的喜剧时刻在移动原生的全屏体验中为自己代言，”网飞产品设计师<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230322205229/https://www.kimho.design/fastlaughs"> Kim Ho </a>说，他之前在脸书、Instacart 和 Coin 从事产品设计。她补充说:“我们努力削减有意和极简的用户界面设计中所必需的东西，从透明的标签栏到在那一刻做出反应的方式(“LOL”)，并通过添加到他们的列表中来计划他们的下一个笑声。”</p>
<p class="translated">尽管“快笑”专注于寻找新的观看内容，但事实上，该功能可以帮助网飞在移动设备上花费的时间方面与抖音竞争，因为它迎合了人们对更短、更“美味”的视频内容日益增长的需求。</p>
<p class="translated">网飞表示，这项功能现在正在 iOS 上推广，并将在未来几个月内在 Android 上开始测试。</p>
