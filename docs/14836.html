<p class="translated">这是一种<span data-amp-original-style="text-decoration: underline;" class="amp-wp-f6bf23d"> <em>巨大的</em> </span>颜色。在我看来，这可能是迄今为止发布的 iPhone 12 最好的颜色。在我看来，苹果发布这款新的紫色调也是在对喜欢 mini 的人说:不要担心，这款产品在一段时间内还会上市。但是，反过来说，这可能是一个迹象，表明这个版本的迷你可能是我们在一段时间内唯一的一个。也许我想得太多了，这是一个“因为我们可以”的主题搭配，为春季买家提供了一个新的选择。无论哪种方式，这都是一款非常好看的手机，符合当前设计和时尚蓬勃发展的“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230321164932/https://blog.sampleboard.com/color-trends-2021-millennial-purple-interior-obsession/">千禧紫”</a>(读作:淡紫色)趋势。苹果的色彩理论团队总是很好地把握趋势，所以这里没有变化。</p>
<p class="translated">苹果还发布了一款漂亮的紫色硅胶保护套，与之相得益彰。</p>
<p class="translated">如果你想深入了解 iPhone 12 mini 的强大功能，请随意参考我们去年年底的评论。</p>
