<p class="translated">商店的布局设计为体验式，突出了公司不断增长的硬件产品组合以及精选的第三方合作伙伴。本质上，这是该公司向游客和当地人展示 Pixel 手机、家用产品、Stadia、WearOS 和硬件组合的最新成员 Fitbit 设备的一种方式。</p>
<p class="translated">“在过去的几年里，我们真的利用弹出窗口来更好地了解客户对我们在谷歌能够提供的独特产品的期望，”副总裁杰森·罗森塔尔在媒体预览周期间表示。我们从 2016 年、2017 年、2018 年和 2019 年的弹出式广告中吸取了经验，并将这些经验融入到我们在切尔西开设的[……]中。"</p>

<p class="translated">由于疫情的限制，预览是虚拟的。虽然它本周对公众开放，但该公司将保持标准的安全预防措施，因为这座城市正在处理(敲敲木头)疫情的尾部。</p>
<p class="translated">虽然新冠肺炎几乎肯定会放缓计划的开放，但谷歌承诺，事情将从明天开始全面生效。这是在几周的试运行之后进行的，在试运行期间，该商店的 50 名左右的员工接受了测试，同时该公司对体验进行了最后的润色。在此之前，谷歌在山景城的一个机库空间建造了一个全尺寸的商店模型来测试想法。</p>

<p class="translated">除了产品屏幕和排列在 17 英尺长的窗户上的立体布景，该公司还在商店里放满了“沙箱”——实际上就像一个客厅，与你在大型家具店中可能找到的没有什么不同——尽管光线更好。这里还有一个游戏区，可以玩 Stadia，还有一个隔音区，可以测试各种家庭/巢穴产品。</p>
<p class="translated">像苹果商店一样，顾客可以带来维修像 Pixels 这样的坏设备。该公司表示，可以现场维修的设备数量正在增加，而某些问题，如屏幕破裂，应该可以在当天得到修复。</p>
