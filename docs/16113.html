<p class="translated">谷歌声称 Tau 家族“跨越”了现有的云虚拟机。这些系统有多种配置，从每个虚拟机 60 个虚拟 CPU 到每个虚拟 CPU 4GB 内存不等。网络带宽高达 32 Gbps，并且它们可以与各种不同的网络连接存储相结合。</p>
<p dir="ltr" class="translated">“各行各业的客户都在处理要求更高、数据密集型的工作负载，并寻找提高性能和降低成本的战略方法，”谷歌云首席执行官托马斯·库里安在一份新闻稿中说。“我们与 AMD 等关键战略合作伙伴的合作使我们能够扩大产品范围，为客户提供计算密集型、业务关键型应用程序的最佳性价比——所有这些都基于业界最干净的<span class="il">云</span>。”</p>
