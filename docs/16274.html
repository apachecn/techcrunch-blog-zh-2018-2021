<p class="translated">微软计划在假期向公众发布<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230220193832/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11"> Windows 11 </a>，所以我们大概可以在 11 月下旬左右期待它的到来。在此之前，我们可能会看到一系列的公开测试，从下周开始。这将是对 Windows 10 用户的免费更新。</p>

<p class="translated">如果你一直关注 Windows 10X 的发展和最终消亡，微软的操作系统为双屏和(最终)单屏笔记本电脑提供了简化的用户界面，你在这里看到的很多东西都会感到熟悉，包括重新设计的开始菜单。事实上，如果有人给你看 Windows 11 的截图和 Windows 10X 的早期预览，你会很难区分它们。</p>

<p class="translated">正如微软首席产品官 Panos Panay 在今天的公告中指出的那样，设计背后的总体想法是让你感觉“一种难以置信的平静感”，但与此同时，Windows 团队也努力让它变得更快。例如，Windows Updates 应该快 40 %,但 Panay 也指出，启动你的机器甚至浏览都应该感觉快得多。</p>

<p class="translated">事实上，微软首席执行官塞特亚·纳德拉表示，他希望开发者有机会在 Windows 11 上构建自己的平台。“Windows 是世界创造的舞台，”他说。“有了这个新版本的 Windows，我们正在释放我们每个人与生俱来的创新和创造力。[……]今天，世界需要一个更加开放的平台——一个允许应用成为独立平台的平台。Windows 是一个平台，比 Windows 更大的东西可以在这里诞生——比如网络。这是我们对 Windows 11 的期望。”</p>
