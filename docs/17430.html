				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">Facebook is out with a new report collecting the most popular posts on the platform, responding to critics who believe the company is deliberately opaque about its top-performing content.</p>
<p class="translated">Facebook’s new “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221209174209/https://transparency.fb.com/data/widely-viewed-content-report/">widely viewed content reports</a>” will come out quarterly, reflecting most viewed top News Feed posts in the U.S. every three months — not exactly the kind of real-time data monitoring that might prove useful for observing emerging trends.</p>
<p class="translated">With the new data set, Facebook hopes to push back against criticism that its algorithms operate within a black box. But like its often misleading blogged rebuttals and the other sets of cherry-picked data it shares, the company’s latest gesture at transparency is better than nothing, but not particularly useful.</p>
<p class="translated">So what <em>do</em> we learn? According to the new data set, 87% of posts that people viewed in the U.S. during Q2 of this year didn’t include an outside link. That’s notable but not very telling since Facebook still has an incredibly massive swath of people sharing and seeing links on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="translated">YouTube is predictably the top domain by Facebook’s chosen metric of “content viewers,” which it defines as any account that saw a piece of content on the News Feed, though we don’t get anything in the way of potentially helpful granular data there. Amazon, Gofundme, TikTok and others also in the top 10, no surprises there either.</p>
<p class="translated">Things get weirder when Facebook starts breaking down its most viewed links. The top five links include a website for alumni of the Green Bay Packers football team, a random online CBD marketplace and reppnforchrist.com, an apparently prominent portal for Christianity-themed graphic T-shirts. The subscription <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221209174209/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/technology/epoch-media-right-wing-disinformation.html">page for the Epoch Times</a>, a site well known for spreading pro-Trump conspiracies and other disinformation, comes in at No 10, though it was beaten by a Tumblr link to two cats walking with their tails intertwined.</p>

<p class="translated">Yahoo and ABC News are the only prominent national media outlets that make the top 20 when the data is sliced and diced in this particular way. Facebook also breaks down which posts the most people viewed during the period with a list of mostly benign if odd memes, including one that reads “If your VAGINA [cat emoji] or PENIS [eggplant emoji] was named after the last TV show/Move u watched what would it be.”</p>
<p class="translated">如果你想知道为什么脸书选择以这种特定的方式收集和展示这组数据，那是因为该公司拼命想证明一点:它的平台没有被成为头条新闻的政治阴谋和有争议的右翼人物淹没。</p>
<p class="translated">该数据集是脸书与《纽约时报》记者凯文·鲁斯(Kevin Roose)长期不和的最新争论，凯文·鲁斯创建了一个 Twitter 账户，每天发布脸书最吸引人的帖子，这是通过脸书拥有的社交监测工具 CrowdTangle 衡量的。</p>

<p class="translated">根据参与度的衡量标准，脸书在美国表现最佳的职位通常由极右翼人士和网站主导，如<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221209174209/https://www.vox.com/2021/7/28/22594550/newsmax-ratings-dive-explained"> Newsmax </a>，这推动了脸书宁愿与其保持距离的选举阴谋。</p>
<p class="translated">该公司认为，互动最多的脸书帖子不能准确代表平台上的顶级内容。脸书坚持认为，衡量有多少人看到一个给定帖子的触达数据是一个优越的指标，但没有理由认为参与度数据不具有同样的相关性，如果不是更高的话。</p>
<p class="translated">“被最多人看到的内容不一定是参与度最高的内容，”脸书写道，这显然是在挖苦卢斯。</p>
<p class="translated">该平台希望全面淡化政治内容，鉴于其放大俄罗斯虚假信息、暴力极右民兵和停止偷窃运动(Stop the Steal movement)的记录，这并不奇怪，该运动在 1 月份的美国国会大厦导致了致命的暴力事件。</p>

<p class="translated">正如《T2 时报》之前报道的那样，脸书实际上放弃了通过公共仪表板广泛提供其 reach 数据的计划，因为担心即使是《T4》中表现最好的帖子的版本也不会给公司带来好的影响。</p>
<p class="translated">相反，该公司选择在一份令人困惑的压缩季度报告中提供这些数据。结果显示了大量莫名其妙的垃圾内容(说真的，包装工网站是怎么回事？)，但较少以政治的方式。尽管脸书粗略地展示了其透明度，但值得记住的是，没有什么能阻止该公司让人们看到其最受欢迎内容的更深入、更广泛的排行榜。这不是那个。</p>
