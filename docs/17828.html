<h1 class="translated">中国综合报道:北京希望科技巨头承担更多社会责任</h1>

				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">大家好，欢迎回到<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/"> TechCrunch 的中国综合报道</a>，这是一份关于塑造中国科技格局的近期事件的摘要，以及这些事件对世界其他地方的人们意味着什么。</p>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">本周，博彩业再次成为北京的目标，北京对未成年玩家施加了可以说是世界上最严格的限制。另一方面，中国的科技巨头们正匆忙响应北京的号召，承担更多的社会责任，从无节制的扩张中解脱出来。</p>
<h2 class="translated">游戏宵禁</h2>
<p class="translated">中国<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/china-restricts-kids-online-gaming-to-three-hours-a-week/">给这个国家的年轻游戏玩家投下了一颗重磅炸弹。自 9 月 1 日起，18 岁以下的用户只能玩一个小时的在线游戏:周五、周六和周日晚上 8-9 点</a></p>
<p class="translated">这项严格的规定增加了已经收紧的未成年人游戏政策，因为政府指责视频游戏导致近视，以及身心健康恶化。还记得中国最近宣布的一系列针对课后辅导的<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">限制</a>吗？流传的笑话是，双职工父母将更难让他们的孩子有事可做。</p>
<p class="translated">新规定的几个方面值得一提。首先，新规定是由国家新闻出版署(NPPA)制定的，该监管机构负责审批中国的游戏产品，并在 2019 年<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/china-restarts-game-approval-process/">冻结了审批程序九个月</a>，导致腾讯等游戏股票暴跌。</p>
<p class="translated">奇怪的是，关于游戏时间的指令来自 NPPA，该机构审查游戏内容并颁发出版许可证。像中国的其他行业一样，电子游戏受到多个主管部门的监管:NPPA；中国最高互联网监管机构——中国网络空间管理局(CAC)；以及工业和信息化部，负责监督中国的工业标准和电信基础设施。</p>
<p class="translated">As analysts long observe, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/xi-elevates-an-obscure-china-regulator-to-take-on-didi-big-tech">mighty CAC</a>, which sits under the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission chaired by President Xi Jinping, has run into “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/digichina/blog/chinas-cyberspace-authorities-set-gain-clout-reorganization/">bureaucratic struggles</a>” with other ministries unwilling to relinquish power. This may well be the case for regulating the lucrative gaming industry.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"/>
<p class="translated">For Tencent and other major gaming companies, the impact of the new rule on their balance sheet may be trifling. Following the news, several listed Chinese gaming firms, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/31/netease-ntes-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">NetEase</a> and<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://www.yicai.com/brief/101159532.html"> 37 Games</a>, hurried to announce that underage players made up less than 1% of their gaming revenues.</p>
<p class="translated">Tencent saw the change coming and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/18/tencent-holding-ltd-tcehy-q2-2021-earnings-call-tr/">disclosed</a> in its Q2 earnings that “under-16-year-olds accounted for only 2.6% of its China-based grossing receipts for games and under-12-year-olds accounted for just 0.3%.”</p>
<p class="translated">These numbers may not reflect the reality, as minors have long found ways around gaming restrictions, such as using an adult’s ID for user registration (just as the previous generation borrowed IDs from adult friends to sneak into internet cafes). Tencent and other gaming firms have vowed to clamp down on these workarounds, forcing kids to seek even more sophisticated tricks, including <span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3147044/chinas-tightened-limits-kids-gaming-time-raise-questions-about">using VPNs</a> to access foreign versions of gaming titles. The cat and mouse game continues. </span></p>
<h2 class="translated">Prosper together</h2>
<p class="translated">While China curtails the power of its tech behemoths, it has also pressured them to take on more social responsibilities, which include respecting the worker’s rights in the gig economy.</p>
<p class="translated">Last week, the Supreme People’s Court of China declared the “996” schedule, working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, illegal. The declaration followed years of worker resistance against the tech industry’s burnout culture, which has manifested in actions like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/china-996/">a GitHub project</a> listing companies practicing “996.”</p>
<p class="translated">Meanwhile, hardworking and compliant employees have often been cited as a competitive advantage of China’s tech industry. It’s in part why some Silicon Valley companies, especially those run by people familiar with China, often set up branches in the country to tap its pool of tech talent.</p>
<p class="translated">The days when overworking is glorified and tolerated seem to be drawing to an end. Both ByteDance and its short video rival Kuaishou recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-authorities-say-overtime-996-policy-is-illegal-2021-08-27/">scrapped</a> their weekend overtime policies.</p>
<p class="translated">Similarly, Meituan announced that it will introduce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://seekingalpha.com/article/4452656-meituans-mpngf-ceo-xing-wang-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">compulsory break time</a> for its food delivery riders. The on-demand services giant has been slammed for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://restofworld.org/2021/china-delivery-apps-strike-labor-meituan/">“inhumane” algorithms</a> that force riders into brutal hours or dangerous driving.</p>
<p class="translated">In groundbreaking moves, ride-hailing giant Didi and Alibaba’s e-commerce rival JD.com have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://www.reuters.com/technology/didi-workers-get-union-groundbreaking-move-chinas-tech-sector-2021-09-01/">set up unions for their staff</a>, though it’s still unclear what tangible impact the organizations will have on safeguarding employee rights.</p>
<p class="translated">Tencent and Alibaba have also acted. On August 17, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/18/c_1310133051.htm">calling for “common prosperity,”</a> which caught widespread attention from the country’s ultra-rich.</p>
<p class="translated">“As China marches towards its second centenary goal, the focus of promoting people’s well-being should be put on boosting common prosperity to strengthen the foundation for the Party’s long-term governance.”</p>
<p class="translated">This week, both Tencent and Alibaba <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221063349/https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-alibaba-invest-155-bln-towards-common-prosperity-2021-09-02/">pledged to invest 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion)</a> in support of “common prosperity.” The purposes of their funds are similar and align neatly with Beijing’s national development goals, from growing the rural economy to improving the healthcare system.</p>
